# Internet Identity Authentication

## What This Is

Internet Identity (II) is the Internet Computer's native authentication system. Users sign in to II-powered apps with passkeys, with an OpenID account (Google, Apple, Microsoft), or through their organization's own SSO; no usernames or passwords. Each user gets a unique principal per app origin, preventing cross-app tracking.

Reference material for this skill lives in `references/`:

- `references/shared-sessions.md`: sharing one sign-in across sibling subdomains, end to end.
- `references/app-metadata.md`: every validation rule for `/.well-known/ii-app-metadata`.
- `references/enterprise-sso.md`: the organization's side of SSO (OIDC client, discovery file, limits, caching).
- `references/rust-identity-attributes.md`: the Rust backend for identity attributes.
- `references/older-api.md`: how `@icp-sdk/auth` 10.x and older differ.

## Prerequisites

- `@icp-sdk/auth@^11` with `@icp-sdk/core@^6`. **Pin both majors together.** auth 11 and 10 peer `@icp-sdk/core@^6`; auth 9 peers `^5`.
- For the Motoko backend: `mo:identity-attributes` >= 0.4.0 (mops), the mixin that injects the two sign-in methods and verifies the attribute bundle. It pulls in `mo:core` >= 2.5.0 and requires `moc` >= 1.6.0 for `include`.

## Canister IDs

| Canister | ID | URL | Purpose |
|----------|----|-----|---------|
| Internet Identity (backend) | `rdmx6-jaaaa-aaaaa-aaadq-cai` | | Mints delegations, signs attribute bundles |
| Internet Identity (frontend) | `uqzsh-gqaaa-aaaaq-qaada-cai` | `https://id.ai` | Serves the sign-in UI; `authorizeUrl` points here |

Both IDs are identical on mainnet and on a local network. Hardcode them.

## Mistakes That Break Your Build

1. **Wrong II URL for the environment.** `authorizeUrl` points at the **frontend** canister: `https://id.ai/authorize` on mainnet, `http://id.ai.localhost:8000/authorize` for a local II (`ii: true`). The URL is used verbatim, so include `/authorize`: `https://id.ai` opens the II home page and never returns a delegation.

2. **Passing `identityProvider` as a string, or half of it.** It is an object, `{ authorizeUrl, canisterId }`, both required together; a string or `URL` throws a `TypeError`. Omit the option entirely to get mainnet II, which is what most apps want.

3. **Top-level `await` in frontend code.** Vite 6 and earlier target `es2020`-era browsers by default, which have no top-level await, so the build fails; Vite 7 allows it. Wrap the setup in an `async function init()` (or a framework lifecycle hook). Code written that way builds on every version. Do NOT change `build.target` to `esnext` to make it compile.

4. **Treating `maxTimeToLive` as the lifetime of the signing key.** It bounds the **session** at II, and `maxTimeToIdle` ends a session nobody uses; the delegation your calls are signed with is short-lived and replaced by the client. Leave both unset unless the app has its own policy: II applies seven days idle and thirty days in total.

5. **Not awaiting `signIn()` or skipping the `try`/`catch`.** `signIn()` rejects when the user closes the popup or authentication fails.

6. **`shouldFetchRootKey` or `fetchRootKey()` in browser code.** The `ic_env` cookie (set by the frontend canister or the Vite dev server) carries the root key as `IC_ROOT_KEY`: pass it as `rootKey` to `HttpAgent.create()` and leave `host` unset. Fetching the root key at runtime lets a man-in-the-middle substitute a fake one on mainnet.

7. **Getting `2vxsx-fae` as the principal.** That is the anonymous principal: authentication silently failed. Usual causes: a wrong `authorizeUrl` (especially missing `/authorize`), an unhandled `signIn()` rejection, or reading the identity before `signIn()` resolved. `getIdentity()` throws `SessionNotHeldError` (not an anonymous identity) when a sign-in exists that this origin holds no credential for.

8. **Passing the principal as an argument.** The backend reads the caller from the IC protocol: `msg.caller` in Motoko, `ic_cdk::api::msg_caller()` in Rust. For access-control patterns see the **canister-security** skill.

9. **Adding `derivationOrigin` or `ii-alternative-origins` for the gateway domains.** II canonicalizes `ic0.app`, `icp0.io`, and `icp.net` to one form, so a canister served at any of them gets the same principal. Adding the configuration for that breaks authentication. A different principal there means a different passkey or device. A genuine second origin (a custom domain) does need it: see "Serving an app at more than one origin".

10. **Generating the attribute nonce on the frontend.** The nonce passed to `requestAttributes` MUST come from the backend (`_internet_identity_sign_in_start`), or the canister cannot check that the bundle's `implicit:nonce` is one it issued, and replay protection is gone.

11. **Reading attribute data without verifying the signer.** The IC verifies the signature, not who signed: any canister can produce a valid bundle. The trusted signer is `rdmx6-jaaaa-aaaaa-aaadq-cai`. Motoko: use the `mo:identity-attributes` mixin with `trusted_attribute_signers` and `frontend_origins` configured. Rust: check `msg_caller_info_signer()` before reading `msg_caller_info_data()`, or an attacker canister can forge `email = "admin@you.com"`.

12. **Substituting `{tid}` in the Microsoft scoped-key prefix.** The `microsoft` provider URL is the literal `https://login.microsoftonline.com/{tid}/v2.0`; keys look like `openid:https://login.microsoftonline.com/{tid}/v2.0:email` exactly. Filling in a tenant ID misses every lookup.

13. **Treating `email` as verified.** `email` is the raw address from the user's II-linked account; II does not check it, so treat it as user input. `verified_email` is present only when II established that the user controls the address: either an OpenID provider (e.g. Google) marked it verified, or the user linked and verified that email with II directly. Gate access on `verified_email` only. There is **no `verified_email` under `sso:`**: an organization's SSO cannot produce one; its `sso:<domain>:email` is asserted by that organization's own provider, so trust it only for domains you list.

14. **Sharing a cookie domain without a shared `derivationOrigin`.** Subdomains only share a sign-in when they share a principal. Without one derivation origin authorized for all of them, the shared record names an account the reading origin can never hold, and `/reauth` bounces the user forever. See `references/shared-sessions.md`.

15. **A silent re-issue without `hint`, on the default transport, or to an undeclared callback.** `prompt: 'none'` without `hint` fails with `InteractionRequiredError` (`reason` `account_selection_required`) when II holds more than one session. It runs on page load with no user gesture, so it needs `transport: 'redirect'` on a route of its own, declared in the origin's `/.well-known/ii-auth-callbacks`, or the redirect never comes back.

16. **Serving `/.well-known/ii-app-metadata` on the wrong origin, without CORS, or with one bad field.** II reads it from the derivation origin (when set) or the request origin, the document and the logo both need CORS, and one invalid field invalidates the whole document. See `references/app-metadata.md`.

17. **Installing majors that do not pair.** auth 11 peers `@icp-sdk/core@^6`; pinning core to `^5` out of habit gives:

    ```text
    npm error ERESOLVE unable to resolve dependency tree
    npm error Found: @icp-sdk/core@5.4.0
    npm error peer @icp-sdk/core@"^6" from @icp-sdk/auth@11.0.0
    ```

    Do not clear it with `--legacy-peer-deps` or `--force`. Pin `@icp-sdk/auth@^11` with `@icp-sdk/core@^6`, or stay on `@icp-sdk/auth@^9` if something else holds you on core 5.

18. **Signing in against a local II without `agentOptions`.** The client mints delegations by calling the II canister through an agent that verifies against the mainnet root key by default. With a local II the ceremony completes and the mint then fails with `TrustError: Certificate verification error` (`"Invalid signature"`). Pass `agentOptions: { rootKey }` from the `ic_env` cookie and leave `host` unset. A local II from an older network launcher lacks the minting methods: run `icp network update` and restart the network.

19. **Scheduling a logout from the delegation's expiration.** The delegation `getIdentity()` signs with is short-lived and replaced as it ages, so a timer from `identity.getDelegation()`'s expiration signs the user out after minutes. The session's end arrives as an `expired` status: subscribe, and leave the signed-in view when `isAuthenticated()` turns false.

20. **Checking an SSO domain from the browser.** Do not `fetch('https://<domain>/.well-known/ii-openid-configuration')` and do not look for `isValidSsoDomain` (removed in 11.x). Build the client with `ssoDomain` and read `getSsoStatus()`: II checks the domain against the same rules it signs in with, and the organization needs no CORS header.

21. **Awaiting the SSO check before `signIn()`, or wrapping the constructor in `try`/`catch` for the domain.** `signIn()` must be called synchronously in the click handler, or Safari blocks the popup. It proceeds in `checking`, `available`, and `unavailable` (II's own screens show progress and errors); the SSO status makes it reject only in `invalid`. In every state it still rejects when the user closes the popup or authentication fails, so attach a rejection handler. The constructor never throws for a malformed domain: it reports `invalid`.

22. **Changing `ssoDomain` or `openIdProvider` on an existing client.** Both are constructor-only, like every other option; there is no setter and no per-`signIn()` override. For a new domain, build a new client and `dispose()` the superseded one.

## Using II during local development

**Default: use mainnet II from the local network.** With `icp-cli >= 0.2.4` the local network trusts the mainnet subnet's signatures, so delegations from `https://id.ai` work against a locally deployed backend. Construct the client with no `identityProvider`.

**Fallback: a local II,** only for fully offline development or a specific II build. Add `ii: true` to the local network in `icp.yaml`:

```yaml
networks:
  - name: local
    mode: managed
    ii: true
```

II is then served at `http://id.ai.localhost:8000`, with the same canister IDs. No canister entry is needed in your project. Pass the local root key:

```javascript
const authClient = new AuthClient({
  identityProvider: {
    authorizeUrl: "http://id.ai.localhost:8000/authorize",
    canisterId: "rdmx6-jaaaa-aaaaa-aaadq-cai",
  },
  agentOptions: { rootKey: canisterEnv?.IC_ROOT_KEY },
});
```

## Frontend: Sign-In Flow

Framework-agnostic; adapt the DOM parts.

```javascript
import { AuthClient } from "@icp-sdk/auth/client";
import { HttpAgent, Actor } from "@icp-sdk/core/agent";
import { safeGetCanisterEnv } from "@icp-sdk/core/agent/canister-env";

// The ic_env cookie carries the root key and canister IDs, locally and on mainnet.
const canisterEnv = safeGetCanisterEnv();

// Mainnet II is the default. derivationOrigin, openIdProvider, ssoDomain,
// stateStorage, transport, prompt, and hint are also constructor options.
const authClient = new AuthClient();

async function signIn() {
  try {
    // Optional session bounds: signIn({ maxTimeToIdle, maxTimeToLive }), in ns.
    return await authClient.signIn();
  } catch (error) {
    console.error("Sign-in failed:", error);
    throw error;
  }
}

// Ends the session at II: every tab of this origin is signed out.
async function signOut() {
  await authClient.signOut();
}

// No host: the default resolves correctly locally, on mainnet, and on custom domains.
async function createAuthenticatedActor(identity, canisterId, idlFactory) {
  const agent = await HttpAgent.create({ identity, rootKey: canisterEnv?.IC_ROOT_KEY });
  return Actor.createActor(idlFactory, { agent, canisterId });
}

// Wrapped in a function: Vite 6 and earlier reject top-level await by default.
async function init() {
  // isAuthenticated() is sync; getIdentity() is async.
  if (authClient.isAuthenticated()) {
    const identity = await authClient.getIdentity();
    const actor = await createAuthenticatedActor(identity, canisterId, idlFactory);
  }

  // getStatus(): 'signed-in' | 'signed-in-elsewhere' | 'expired' | 'signed-out'.
  // subscribe() fires on any change, including in another tab.
  authClient.subscribe(() => render(authClient.getStatus()));
}

init();
```

**Lifecycle.** One client for the page, or one per component: both read and write the same sign-in. A client a view owns is disposed with it: `dispose()` releases its listeners, subscription, and scheduled refresh, and is **not** a sign-out.

## One-click sign-in

`openIdProvider` (`'google'`, `'apple'`, `'microsoft'`) or `ssoDomain` (an organization's domain) skips II's method screen. They are mutually exclusive (a type error, and a throw at construction) and constructor-only.

```javascript
const google = new AuthClient({ openIdProvider: "google" });
const acme = new AuthClient({ ssoDomain: "acme.com" });
```

### Checking an organization's domain

A client built with `ssoDomain` checks its own domain through II as soon as it is constructed and reports the result like the session: a synchronous snapshot from `getSsoStatus()`, change notifications from `subscribe()`. No exceptions, no `AbortSignal`.

```typescript
type SsoStatus =
  | { state: "checking" }
  | { state: "available"; name?: string }      // name from the org's file: "Continue with Acme Corp"
  | { state: "invalid" }                       // not a domain: the user should fix the input
  | { state: "unavailable"; retryAfter?: Date }; // no SSO there, or failing
```

Checking while the user types:

```javascript
let client;

input.addEventListener("input", () => {
  client?.dispose();                                   // also stops the old client's check
  client = new AuthClient({ ssoDomain: input.value }); // never throws for the domain
  client.subscribe(() => render(client.getSsoStatus()));
  render(client.getSsoStatus());
});

function render(sso) {
  switch (sso.state) {
    case "checking":    return showSpinner();
    case "available":   return enableContinue(sso.name);
    case "invalid":     return showNotADomain();
    case "unavailable": return showUnavailable(sso.retryAfter);
  }
}

// Synchronous in the click handler: never await the check first.
continueButton.addEventListener("click", () => {
  client?.signIn().then(showApp, showSignInError);
});
```

- A superseded client is disposed before it can publish, so stale results never render. The check reaches II only after a short delay, so a debounce is optional.
- `refreshSsoStatus()` re-runs the check for a "Try again" button. While `retryAfter` is in the future, II answers `unavailable` again at once with no new fetch, so disable the button and show a countdown ("Try again in 2 min"). It does nothing on an `invalid` client: the user fixes the input, which builds a new client. A client never re-checks by itself.
- `signIn()` proceeds in `checking`, `available`, and `unavailable`: II resolves the domain itself and shows its own loading and error screens. Of the four states, only `invalid` makes it reject; a closed popup or failed authentication rejects in any state.
- The check warms II's cache, so `signIn()` on the same client starts fast.

How the organization sets up its side (OIDC client, the `ii-openid-configuration` file, per-app access, the limits that reject the file, caching): `references/enterprise-sso.md`.

## Identity attributes

When the backend needs more than the principal (e.g. a verified email), II returns a signed attribute bundle alongside the delegation. The backend exposes two methods: `_internet_identity_sign_in_start` mints a nonce, `_internet_identity_sign_in_finish` verifies the bundle. Motoko gets both from the `mo:identity-attributes` mixin; Rust implements them by hand (`references/rust-identity-attributes.md`). The frontend is the same against either.

### Keys

`requestAttributes({ keys, nonce })` requires both; there is no default key set.

| Key | Meaning | Use for |
|---|---|---|
| `name` | Display name from the user's II-linked account | Personalisation |
| `email` | Raw address from the II-linked account; **II does not check it** | Contact info, mailing lists |
| `verified_email` | Present only when II established the user controls the address (an OpenID provider marked it verified, or the user verified it with II) | Access gating; the only email to authorise on |

Request both `email` and `verified_email` for fallback: when verified, both carry the same value; otherwise only `email` arrives.

`scopedKeys` scopes keys to the account the user signs in with, so they are shared in the same step with no extra prompt:

| Call | Keys | Default `keys` |
|---|---|---|
| `scopedKeys({ openIdProvider: 'google' })` | `openid:https://accounts.google.com:<key>` | `name`, `email`, `verified_email` |
| `scopedKeys({ openIdProvider: 'apple' })` | `openid:https://appleid.apple.com:<key>` | same |
| `scopedKeys({ openIdProvider: 'microsoft' })` | `openid:https://login.microsoftonline.com/{tid}/v2.0:<key>` (`{tid}` literal) | same |
| `scopedKeys({ ssoDomain: 'acme.com' })` | `sso:acme.com:<key>` | `name`, `email` (no `verified_email`) |

Pass `keys` to narrow, e.g. `scopedKeys({ openIdProvider: 'google', keys: ['name', 'verified_email'] })`.

### Frontend

```javascript
import { AuthClient } from "@icp-sdk/auth/client";
import { AttributesIdentity } from "@icp-sdk/core/identity";
import { HttpAgent, Actor } from "@icp-sdk/core/agent";
import { safeGetCanisterEnv } from "@icp-sdk/core/agent/canister-env";
import { Principal } from "@icp-sdk/core/principal";

const II_PRINCIPAL = "rdmx6-jaaaa-aaaaa-aaadq-cai";
const rootKey = safeGetCanisterEnv()?.IC_ROOT_KEY;

async function signInWithAttributes(authClient, canisterId, idl) {
  // Anonymous handle, used only to mint the nonce.
  const anonymousActor = Actor.createActor(idl, { agent: await HttpAgent.create({ rootKey }), canisterId });

  // In parallel, one interaction for the user. `nonce` is a function the client
  // calls when it needs the value, so the request is in flight while II opens.
  const signInPromise = authClient.signIn();
  const attributesPromise = authClient.requestAttributes({
    keys: ["name", "verified_email"],
    nonce: () => anonymousActor._internet_identity_sign_in_start(),
  });

  const identity = await signInPromise;
  const attributes = await attributesPromise;

  // The bundle travels as sender_info on each call made with this identity.
  const verifiedAgent = await HttpAgent.create({
    identity: new AttributesIdentity({
      inner: identity,
      attributes,
      signer: { canisterId: Principal.fromText(II_PRINCIPAL) },
    }),
    rootKey,
  });
  const verifiedActor = Actor.createActor(idl, { agent: verifiedAgent, canisterId });

  const result = await verifiedActor._internet_identity_sign_in_finish();
  if ("err" in result) {
    throw new Error(`Attribute verification failed: ${JSON.stringify(result.err)}`);
  }
  return identity;
}
```

For one-click sign-in, build the client with `openIdProvider` or `ssoDomain`, add `scopedKeys` to the `@icp-sdk/auth/client` import, and request `scopedKeys({ openIdProvider: "google", keys: ["name", "verified_email"] })` or `scopedKeys({ ssoDomain: "acme.com" })` instead; the rest is unchanged.

Every bundle carries three implicit fields the backend MUST verify: `implicit:nonce` (one it issued and has not consumed), `implicit:origin` (a trusted frontend origin), `implicit:issued_at_timestamp_ns` (fresh, typically within five minutes).

### Backend: Motoko

```toml
[dependencies]
identity-attributes = "0.4.1"
core                = "2.5.0"

[toolchain]
moc = "1.6.0"
```

`include IdentityAttributes({ onVerified })` injects both methods and runs `onVerified` only on a bundle that passes the signer, origin, nonce, and freshness checks. It resolves the bundle to `{ name : ?Text; email : ?Text; sso : ?Text }`:

- OpenID and unscoped sources: `email` comes from `verified_email` (or `openid:<provider>:verified_email`), which is why the frontend requests `verified_email`.
- SSO sources: `name` and `email` come from `sso:<domain>:name` / `sso:<domain>:email`, accepted only for a domain in `trusted_sso_domains`, and `sso` is that domain. Otherwise `sso` is `null`.

```motoko
import IdentityAttributes "mo:identity-attributes";
import Map "mo:core/Map";
import Principal "mo:core/Principal";

persistent actor {
  type Profile = { name : ?Text; email : ?Text; sso : ?Text };

  let profiles = Map.empty<Principal, Profile>();

  include IdentityAttributes({
    onVerified = func(caller, attrs) {
      profiles.add(caller, attrs);
    };
  });

  public shared query ({ caller }) func getProfile() : async ?Profile {
    profiles.get(caller)
  };
};
```

```yaml
canisters:
  - name: backend
    settings:
      environment_variables:
        # Required. A local II (`ii: true`) has the same principal.
        trusted_attribute_signers: "rdmx6-jaaaa-aaaaa-aaadq-cai"
        # Required, comma-separated.
        frontend_origins: "https://your-app.icp.net"
        # Optional, comma-separated; omit to reject all sso:* keys.
        trusted_sso_domains: "your-org.com"
```

Unset `trusted_attribute_signers` rejects every bundle as untrusted; unset `frontend_origins` makes `_internet_identity_sign_in_finish` return `#err(#FrontendOriginsNotConfigured)`. The error variants (`#NoAttributes`, `#MalformedCandid`, `#FrontendOriginMismatch`, `#Stale`, `#UnknownNonce`, `#AmbiguousAttribute`, `#UntrustedSsoSource`, `#MixedSsoSources`) tell the frontend whether to retry with a fresh nonce or surface a bug.

## Serving an app at more than one origin

II derives a principal per **origin**, so `https://<canister-id>.icp.net` and `https://shop.example.com` are two different users. Pick **one** derivation origin (the canister address: custom domains can change, the canister address cannot) and list the others as alternative origins. Pin it before an origin has users: repointing an origin with existing sign-ins orphans every account made under it.

1. The alternative origin passes `derivationOrigin`; the primary origin does not:

   ```js
   const authClient = new AuthClient({ derivationOrigin: "https://<canister-id>.icp.net" });
   ```

2. The derivation origin serves `/.well-known/ii-alternative-origins` (in the static-site build, `dir/.well-known/ii-alternative-origins`):

   ```json
   { "alternativeOrigins": ["https://shop.example.com"] }
   ```

   At most **100** entries, origins only (no trailing slash, no path). Over the cap, II rejects the **entire list** ("has too many entries: To prevent misuse at most 100 alternative origins are allowed"): every alternative origin stops authenticating, not just the extras.

3. With `@dfinity/static-site`, add a `_headers` block (the file has no extension, and certified assets set no CORS header by default):

   ```
   /.well-known/ii-alternative-origins
     Content-Type: application/json
     Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *
   ```

Sharing one sign-in across sibling subdomains builds on this: `references/shared-sessions.md`.

## App metadata on the sign-in screen

Serve `/.well-known/ii-app-metadata` (`{ "name", "description", "logo" }`, all optional) on the derivation origin, with CORS on the document and the logo, and II shows your app's name, tagline, and logo next to the origin. `name` at most 40 and `description` at most 120 code points; `logo` a relative URL to a same-origin raster image (no SVG). One invalid field invalidates the whole document. Full rules: `references/app-metadata.md`.

## Backend: Access Control

Anonymous-principal rejection, role guards, and caller binding in async functions are not II-specific: see the **canister-security** skill.
